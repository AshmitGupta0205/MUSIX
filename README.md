# MUSIX - AI-Powered Audio Processing

MUSIX is a web-based application that provides advanced audio processing capabilities using AI models like **htdemucs**. The project consists of two main components:

1. **Home.py - Web-Based AI Audio Separator**
2. Karaoke-Maker.py - Karaoke Maker

---

## ðŸŽµ Web-Based AI Audio Separator (`Home.py`)
This tool allows users to separate vocals and instrumentals from songs using the **htdemucs** model.

### Features:
- **Upload an MP3/WAV file** or fetch a song from **YouTube**.
- **Separate audio into different stems** (Vocals, Instrumental, Drums, Bass, Other).
- **Download processed stems** after separation.
- **Uses htdemucs** for high-quality music separation.

### How to Use:
1. Run `Home.py` using Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```
2. Upload an audio file or enter a YouTube link.
3. Select the number of stems to extract.
4. Click "Separate Audio" and download the results.

## ðŸŽ¤ Karaoke Maker (`Karaoke-Maker.py`)
This module transforms a song into a **karaoke track** by removing vocals and allowing users to sing along.

### Features:
- **Fetch songs from an online API** and download the track.
- **Remove vocals** using htdemucs to keep only the instrumental.
- **Play the instrumental track** while recording the user's voice.
- **Merge the recorded voice with the instrumental** to create a final karaoke mix.

### How to Use:
1. Run `Home.py`using streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```
2. Change the page to Karaoke Maker.
3. Enter a song name to fetch and process it.
4. Sing along while the instrumental plays in the background.
5. Save and download the final karaoke mix.
